    "# Things to remember about `git` and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "## `git` ≠ GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "There's been some confusion about what's the difference between `git` and GitHub, and specifically when you make changes using `git` but don't see them on GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `git` is the program you use for tracking changes\n",
    "This will be a sped-up version of the `git` intro from Software Carpentry and will hit all the high points that you need to remember for working with `git` in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a fresh new repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd ~/code\n",
    "$ mkdir biom262-git-test\n",
    "$ cd biom262-git-test\n",
    "$ git init\n",
    "Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/olga/workspace-git/biom262-git-test/.git/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what `git` knows about this file using `git status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial commit\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no files here yet. Just like in the git tutorial, we'll create a few empty files and then see how this changes the `git` repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ touch pipeline.sh\n",
    "$ touch statistics.sh\n",
    "$ touch plots.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We should now see a few files, both using `ls` (which literally tells us which files are there) and `git status` (which tells us what `git` knows about the files)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "pipeline.sh   plots.sh      statistics.sh\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial commit\n",

    "Untracked files:\n",

    "\tplots.sh\n",
    "\tstatistics.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, **`git` has no idea that these files matter to you**. Where it says \"`Untracked files`\", it shows a list of files that `git` sees, but doesn't think you care about so it's not *tracking* their changes. Let's `git add` and `git commit` these files. I'm going to be lazy and add everything that ends in \"`.sh`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git add *.sh\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial commit\n",
    "\n",

    "\tnew file:   statistics.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh wait I don't want to commit `plots.sh` yet. So let's remove it using `git`'s hint of `git rm --cached <file>` to \"unstage.\" You can think of \"staging\" as the \"staging area\" like if you're corralling cattle \n",
    "\n",
    "So in TSCC you edited some files in a `git` repository. You then do `git status` and see \n",
    "\n",
    "You used `git` on TSCC to `git add` and `git commit` files\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub is the place you put files so you don't lose your dissertation work when you computer explodes\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've `git add`'d, `git commit`'d and everything, GitHub (the place) still has no idea what you've done. It's only when you `git push` and `git pull` that you talk to GitHub and tell them you've made some updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git pull upstream master\n",
    "$ git push origin week04\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forks ≠ Clones\n",
    "\n",
    "When you \"Fork\" a repository (repo), you make a copy that you personally can edit, commit, add, and push changes to. When you \"Clone\" a repository, you're copying all history of all code that was ever written in that project. If it's your project, then you have write access. Otherwise, no. Usually you don't have write access to things you're cloning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## No `LICENSE` = no fun\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we didn't go over in class is that if your code is up somewhere publicly available without an explicit license, then technically nobody is allowed to use it. That's why using a license for your code (I recommend the [UCSD-specific 3-Clause BSD license \"UCSD Software Copyright Notice\"](https://confluence.crbs.ucsd.edu/display/CRBS/Releasing+Open+Source+Software+at+UCSD) we used for the first homework because it allows for the most people to use it - academics, companies, industry, non-profit, for-profit - without restrictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's another license called the GPL that many people use and is (in my opinion) a little idealistic because it prevents the usage of the code in a properitary setting (i.e. Microsoft can't use it privately within the compnay). If you're interested in open source license, I encourage you to browse [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Branches are useful for working on homework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are great because you can work on one notebook in one branch and leave the other code completely untouched and then switch to another branch and work on some other notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with branches\n",
